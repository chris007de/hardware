A very simple case design, can be manufactured using acrylic using a lasercutter, for example.

top.svg and bottom.svg are vector data for the cutting, top_decoration.svg can be used for raster engraving.

Parts needed:
  * 2pcs  10cm x 13cm acrylic glass/wood/..
  * 4pcs  M3x28mm screw
  * 8pcs M3      screw nut
  * 8pcs M3      nylon screw nut (or any other isolating material - alternatively, isolating washers)

Here is what it looks like (without engraving):
